    For double ended measurements it is important to enter the correct length

    This function can be used to find the shift of the backward channel so
    that the forward channel and the backward channel are aligned. The shift
    index refers to the x-dimension.

    The attenuation should be approximately a straight line with jumps at the
    splices. Temperature independent and invariant over time. The following
    objective functions seems to do the job at determining the best shift for
    which the attenuation is most straight.

    Err1 sums the first derivative. Is a proxy for the length of the
    attenuation line. Err2 sums the second derivative. Is a proxy for the
    wiggelyness of the line.

    The top plot shows the origional Stokes and the origional and shifted
    anti-Stokes The bottom plot is generated that shows the two objective

        Example: np.arange(-250, 200, 1, dtype=int). It shifts the return
        scattering with 250 indices. Calculates err1 and err2. Then shifts
        the return scattering with 249 indices. Calculates err1 and err2. The
        lowest err1 and err2 are suggested as best shift options.
