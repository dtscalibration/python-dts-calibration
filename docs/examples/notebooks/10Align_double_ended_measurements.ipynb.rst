10. Align double ended measurements
===================================

The cable length was initially configured during the DTS measurement.
For double ended measurements it is important to enter the correct
length so that the forward channel and the backward channel are aligned.

This notebook shows how to better align the forward and the backward
measurements. Do this before the calibration steps.

.. code:: ipython3

    import os
    from dtscalibration import read_silixa_files
    from dtscalibration.datastore_utils import suggest_cable_shift_double_ended, shift_double_ended
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline

.. code:: ipython3

    suggest_cable_shift_double_ended?

.. code:: ipython3

    filepath = os.path.join('..', '..', 'tests', 'data', 'double_ended2')
    
    ds_aligned = read_silixa_files(
        directory=filepath,
        timezone_netcdf='UTC',
        file_ext='*.xml')  # this one is already correctly aligned

    6 files were found, each representing a single timestep
    6 recorded vars were found: LAF, ST, AST, REV-ST, REV-AST, TMP
    Recorded at 1693 points along the cable
    The measurement is double ended

Use obj.tz_localize(None) or obj.tz_convert('UTC').tz_localize(None) instead

Because our loaded files were already nicely aligned, we are purposely
offsetting the forward and backward channel by 3 \`spacial indicesâ€™.

.. code:: ipython3

    ds_notaligned = shift_double_ended(ds_aligned, 3)

    I dont know what to do with the following data ['tmp']


The device-calibrated temperature doesnot have a valid meaning anymore
and is dropped

.. code:: ipython3

    suggested_shift = suggest_cable_shift_double_ended(
        ds_notaligned, 
        np.arange(-5, 5), 
        plot_result=True, 
        figsize=(12,8))

The two approaches suggest a shift of -3 and -4. It is up to the user
which suggestion to follow. Usually the two suggested shift are close

.. code:: ipython3

    ds_restored = shift_double_ended(ds_notaligned, suggested_shift[0])

.. code:: ipython3

    print(ds_aligned.x, 3*'\n', ds_restored.x)

Note that our fiber has become shorter by 2*3 spatial indices
