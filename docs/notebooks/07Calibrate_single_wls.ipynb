    "A single-ended calibration is performed where the unknown parameters are estimated using fiber sections that have a reference temperature. The parameters are estimated with a weighted least squares optimization using Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements from all timesteps. Thus Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements with a large signal to noise ratio contribute more towards estimating the optimal parameter set. But an estimate of the noise variance is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-ended calibration requires a few steps. Please have a look at [1] for more information:\n",
    "1. Read the raw data files loaded from your DTS machine\n",
    "2. Define the reference sections: fiber sections that have a known temperature.\n",
    "3. Estimate the variance of the noise in the Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements\n",
    "4. Perform the parameter search and compute the temperature along the entire fiber.\n",
    "5. Compute the confidence intervals for the temperature\n",
