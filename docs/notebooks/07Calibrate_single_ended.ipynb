    "A single-ended DTS measurement setup is a setup where the measurements are taken from one ending of the fiber, e.g., only one ending is connected to the DTS device. Opposed to double-ended setups, where measurements are taken from both endings of the fiber, the calibration of single-ended setups require the additional assumption that the losses (differential attenuation) is constant along the fiber. E.g., a sharp bend result additional losses and causes a false jump in the temperature. The estimation of the measurement uncertainty also assumes constant losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-ended calibration is performed where the unknown parameters are estimated using fiber sections that have a reference temperature. The parameters are estimated with a weighted least squares optimization using Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements from all timesteps. Thus Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements with a large signal to noise ratio contribute more towards estimating the optimal parameter set, but an estimate of the noise variance is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-ended calibration requires a few steps:\n",
    "1. Read the raw data files loaded from your DTS machine\n",
    "2. Define the reference sections: fiber sections that have a known temperature.\n",
    "3. Estimate the variance of the noise in the Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements\n",
    "4. Perform the parameter search and compute the temperature along the entire fiber.\n",
    "5. Plot the temperature and uncertainty of the estimated temperature\n",
