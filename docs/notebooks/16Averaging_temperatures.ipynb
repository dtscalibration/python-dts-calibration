    "### Introduction confidence intervals\n",
    "The confidence intervals consist of two sources of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measurement noise in the measured Stokes and anti-Stokes signals. Expressed in a single variance value.\n",
    "2. Inherent to least squares procedures / overdetermined systems, the parameters are estimated with limited certainty and all parameters are correlated. Which is expressed in the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sources of uncertainty are propagated to an uncertainty in the estimated temperature via Monte Carlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are all computed with `ds.conf_int_double_ended()` and `ds.conf_int_single_ended()`.\n",
    "The confidence interval can be estimated if the calibration method is `wls` (so that the parameter uncertainties are estimated), `st_var`, `ast_var`, `rst_var`, `rast_var` are correctly estimated, and confidence intervals are passed to `conf_ints`. As weigths are correctly passed to the least squares procedure, the covariance matrix can be used as an estimator for the uncertainty in the parameters. This matrix holds the covariances between all the parameters. A large parameter set is generated from this matrix as part of the Monte Carlo routine, assuming the parameter space is normally distributed with their mean at the best estimate of the least squares procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large parameter set is used to calculate a large set of temperatures. By using `percentiles` or `quantile` the 95% confidence interval of the calibrated temperature between 2.5% and 97.5% are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four types of averaging schemes are implemented:\n",
    "1. Averaging over time while the temperature varies over time and along the fiber\n",
    "2. Averaging over time while assuming the temperature remains constant over time but varies along the fiber\n",
    "3. Averaging along the fiber while the temperature varies along the cable and over time\n",
    "4. Averaging along the fiber while assuming the temperature is same along the fiber but varies over time\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions only work with the same size DataStore as that was calibrated. If you would like to average only a selection use the keyword arguments `ci_avg_time_sel`, `ci_avg_time_isel`, `ci_avg_x_sel`, `ci_avg_x_isel`."
