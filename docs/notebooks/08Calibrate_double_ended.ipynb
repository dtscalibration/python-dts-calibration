    "A double-ended calibration is performed where the unknown parameters are estimated using fiber sections that have a reference temperature. The parameters are estimated with a weighted least squares optimization using Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements from all timesteps. Thus Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements with a large signal to noise ratio (close to the DTS device) contribute more towards estimating the optimal parameter set. This approach requires one extra step, estimating the variance of the noise in the Stokes measurements, but it improves the temperature estimate and allows for the estimation of uncertainty in the temperature. So well worth it!\n",
